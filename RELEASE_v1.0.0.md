### 📋 Requirements

"List all available JIRA projects"
"Show issues in ECAPP project for release 25.28"
"Generate a markdown summary of all high-priority bugs"
"Find issues assigned to me that are still open"
"Search issues with JQL: project = ECAPP AND status = 'In Progress'"
```

### 🔧 What Gets Created

The setup script creates a complete project structure:

```
